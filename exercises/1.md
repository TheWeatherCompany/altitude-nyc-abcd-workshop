## 1. Define a Fastly service with Terraform

### 1.1 main.tf
Create a file named `main.tf` within the `terraform` directory and edit it using your text editor of choice:
```sh
$ touch terraform/main.tf
```
> _What's this?_
A Terraform file `.tf` houses your configurations. Configurations are written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is designed for human consumption so users can quickly interpret and understand their infrastructure configuration. Configuration can be in a single file or split across multiple files.


### 1.2 Fastly provider
In the same Terraform configuration named `main.tf` create Fastly provider definition:
```hcl
provider "fastly" {
  api_key = "<REPLACE WITH YOUR TOKEN>"
}
```
> _What's this?_ 
A provider is an abstraction of the API/service provider such as AWS, GCP, DNSimple, or Fastly. Providers typically require some sort of configuration data such as an API key or credential file.


### 1.3 Fastly resource
Define a new Fastly service resource block and set the backend to point to the GCS bucket which contains our demo website.
```hcl
resource "fastly_service_v1" "service" {
  name = "<YOUR NEW SERVICE NAME>"
  force_destroy = false
}
```

In the same resource block configure your default domain to be used on your service
```hcl
  # Ficitious domain name
  domain {
    name    = "<SERVICE NAME>.fastly-altitude-2017.com"
    comment = "Demo domain"
  }
```
Then define your origin backend. For the purpose of the demo are going to connect to a pre-existing GCS bucket `altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage` which hosts the files for our demo website. 

```hcl
  # GCS backend containing our website files
  backend {
    address               = "storage.googleapis.com"
    ssl_hostname          = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage.storage.googleapis.com"
    name                  = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage"
    port                  = 443
    first_byte_timeout    = 3000
    max_conn              = 200
    between_bytes_timeout = 1000
  }
```
Finally, our backend requires a header override condition. Just as you can do via the Fastly web UI, we can define the condition as a block within our resource declaration.
```hcl
  # Header override condition to 
  header {
    name        = "backend-host-override"
    action      = "set"
    type        = "request"
    destination = "http.Host"
    source      = "\"altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage.storage.googleapis.com\""
  }
}
```

Your `main.tf` should now look something like this: 
```hcl
provider "fastly" {
  api_key = "6527a3da0bc7e74d3eec6a9aed654681
"
}

resource "fastly_service_v1" "service" {
  name = "my-altitude-service"

  force_destroy = fasle

  domain {
    name    = "my-altitude-service.fastly-altitude-2017.com"
    comment = "Demo domain"
  }

  backend {
    address               = "storage.googleapis.com"
    ssl_hostname          = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage.storage.googleapis.com"
    name                  = "altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage"
    port                  = 443
    first_byte_timeout    = 3000
    max_conn              = 200
    between_bytes_timeout = 1000
  }

  header {
    name        = "backend-host-override"
    action      = "set"
    type        = "request"
    destination = "http.Host"
    source      = "\"altitude-nyc-abcd-2017-stage.storage.googleapis.com\""
  }
}
```

### 1.4 Terraform CLI
Terraform is a local tool (runs on the current machine rather than the cloud) and all interactions with Terraform occur via the CLI. Using the command `terraform`, this binary should have been installed at the install stage of the workshop.

Run `terraform help` to generate the full list of Terraform commands.
```sh
$ terraform help
```

For the purpose of the workshop we will be focusing on the commands `plan` and `apply` to create our Fastly service.


### 1.5 Terraform plan
Now that we've defined our service configuration in our `terraforn/main.tf` file we want to observe what will happen if we were to deploy and apply these changes to our Fastly account. We can do this by running the `terraform plan` CLI command:
```sh
$ terraform plan ./terraform
```
> _What's this?_ 
The plan shows you what will happen. You can save plans to guarantee what will happen
Plans show reasons for certain actions (such as re-create). Prior to Terraform, users had to guess change ordering, parallelization, and rollout effect.

You should see the change graph output in your terminal.


### 1.6 Terraform apply
We should now have confidence after viewing our plan that Terraform is going to create our new Fastly service with the desired configuration. Therefore, all that is left is to apply our changes to Fastly in production. As with `plan`, we can run `terraform apply` on our `main.tf` created in the last section. This will create real resources in Fastly.

```sh
$ terraform apply ./terraform
```
> _What's this?_ 
Updates existing resources when updates are allowed otherwise re-creates existing resources when updates are not allowed. Changes are executed in order based on the resource graph and parallelizes changes when possible. Handles and recovers transient errors.

You will be able to watch the resources being created in real-time in our terminal. If successful you should see an output such as:

```sh
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```


### 1.7 Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
If your configuration was successfully applied you should be able to `curl` your newly created service:
```sh 
$ curl -v http://<YOUR SERVICE DOMAIN>.global.prod.fastly.net/index.html

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600

Content-Length: 11651
Connection: keep-alive
X-Served-By: cache-lcy1136-LCY
X-Cache: HIT
X-Cache-Hits: 1
```
If you don't believe this you can even login to the Fastly web interface and look at your configuration.
